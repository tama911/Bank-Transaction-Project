<h1>Bank Transaction</h1>
<hr><p>It is a Java and Spring Boot-based transfer service API for simple bank transactions in fund transfer between accounts. This API has an in-memory data storage enabler, which exposes a RESTful interface to be used for performing transfers and account balance inquiries.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>My project is a Transfer Service API realized in Java using Spring Boot. The main goal of the project is to create a simple yet effective RESTful API that covers basic bank transactions: transfer between accounts. It also enables the feature to check account balances.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>It offers a simple, yet reliable RESTful API for financial transactions between accounts. The problem solved by the project is one of secure funds transfer, updating account balances precisely, and validation of the transactions. This gives a smooth solution to account management and testing, allowing any developer to easily implement and test financial operations like transfers, ensuring data consistency and avoiding errors like overdrafts.</li>

</ul><h2>Setup</h2>
<hr><p>We aim to construct a TransferService API that allows money transfers between accounts. The input should be the source account number and destination account number and the transfer amount as parameters. Following this, it returns an appropriate response. The information will be stored in memory, and for the web framework, we can use any supporting Python, Java, or JavaScript. No UI or authentication is needed. This will guarantee solution reliability by adding tests against proper endpoint functioning, making the code robust and failsafe.</p><h2>Project Status</h2>
